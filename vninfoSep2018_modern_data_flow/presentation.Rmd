# Introduction and Motivation 
## Introduction 

* Your profiles ? A little survey to start
* My profile: 
    - Maths & Engineer background 
    - 4 years in Economic & Finance Studies 
    - 3 years as Data Scientist 
    - Still not a specialist Data Scientist, good enough to get more specialised

## Context and Motivation 

* The context: 
    - Data, Intelligence, Knowledge, Insights, etc are forms of information
    - The current digital revolution has changed the landscape of these values. They happen to co-exist more and more inside a business unit. 
    - The data asset has become more and more messy. 
* The motivation:
    - A try to make the data portfolio less messy and more structured 
    - A plan allowing us to predict future trends
