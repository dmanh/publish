# Introduction and Motivation 
## Introduction 

* Your profiles ? A little survey to start
* My profile: 
    - Maths & Engineer background 
    - 4 years in Economic & Finance Studies 
    - 3 years as Data Scientist 
    - Still not a specialist Data Scientist, good enough to get more specialised

## Context and Motivation 

* **The context**: The digital revolution has been changing the landscape of our society
    - Information versus Data
    - Digitalisation Process: Smartphones, Social Networks & IoTs
    - **Humans** and **Machines** together
    - New jobs and old jobs evolving: Business Analyst, BI, Data Engineers, Data Architect, Data Scientist, Data Analyst etc
    - Transition from model-centric to data-centric 
* **The motivation**:
    - A data-centric discussion about data assets, applications and the business 
    - A look in the past, the present to look further into the future 
    
# The data portfolio structure
## data-centric vs model-centric
![data-centric vs model-centric](./pngs/data_model.png)

* Models are more useful for humans than data. We teach models, theories and not data. 
* When new data are like old data, use current models instead. When not, develop new models. 
* Data-centric dominates model-centric each time there is an explosion of new data: 
    - Telescope invention with Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and Newton

## The data assets

* Data as in IT which is almost everything:  
    - Big data with the 4Vs: volume, variety, veracity and velocity
    - Structured vs Non-structured or SQL vs No-SQL database or CSV vs JSON 
    - Good quality and bad quality 
    - Machine friendly vs human friendly
    - Raw data vs distilled data (most of the time aggregated data)
    - Internal vs external or private vs open data 
    - Storage, Extraction, Search, Data Mining, Data Science
* Of course, there are still a lot of information which has not appeared as IT data form, so out of IT reach 

## Digital assets (intelligence)

* Intelligence is the information whose value lies between data and knowledge. Intelligence is a bit of information by processing data locally. It is actionable but might not able to apply more broadly as knowledge
* Intelligence as Machine Learning Model 


## Digital assets (knowledge)

* Knowledge is a bit of information after processing data across larger domains and through larger time frames. Think of knowledge as scientific knowledge 


## The evolution of digital assets 


* More tangible 
* More intergrated 
* More interactive 
* More messy 
    
## Some historical perspectives 

* The whole flow of information processing is not new: 
    - Story about Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and Newton: with the telescope and gravitational theory 
    - Or Gutenberg with the invention of the printer
    - etc 
* All information now just flows through digital means. Machines are computers, CPU, GPU. 
    
## The flow of digital assets 


## The different corresponding jobs 

* Data engineer 
* Data admin
* Data architect
* Data scientist
* Data analyst 
* Business Analyst 
* Project manager 

# Conclusion 
## What we are heading to then ? 

* Humans and machines collaboration to serve human society
* Human as a social animal
